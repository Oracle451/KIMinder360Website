I am also a Jaguars fan so I tend to be disappointed on Sundays. I also love to be active whether that be going to the gym, playing sports, or enjoying a hike of some kind</p>

                <p><strong>About Me:</strong> I spend much of my free time playing competitive video games, my favorite games being Teamfight Tactics and Street Fighter. I enjoy the mix of problem solving, strategizing, and constant skill growth that come with striving for the highest levels of those games. The thrill of seeking some small improvement to my gameplay every time I play keeps me coming back. I also love exploring new music from all sorts of genres and want to explore music production in the future</p>

                <p><strong>Major:</strong> Software Engineering</p>
                <p><strong>About Me:</strong> I got into software engineering for 2 major reasons, first of all I enjoy the unique problem solving and logical solutions that programming calls for and second of all I want to make applications that benefit people in some way whether it be helping them organize their lives better or just have fun. Every project I work on I want to have a feeling of polish and completeness that brings quality to the user experience and I look forward to bringing these values to KIMinder360.

                <p><strong>Role:</strong> Architect</p>
                <p><strong>Major:</strong> Computer Science</p>
                <p><strong>About Me:</strong> I am deeply interested in contributing technical and software tools for the Navajo Nation, including projects that contribute to cultural knowledge and provide aid for the elderly. I was previously an educator at a community school on the reservation, where I contributed to a computer building club. At NAU, I hope to apply my knowledge and pass it on to the Native youth in my community. On my own time, I enjoy arts and crafts such as crocheting, beading, and weaving, as well as traveling to concerts of all genres.</p>
